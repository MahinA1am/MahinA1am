## 👋 Hi, I'm Mahin Alam!

🎓 Final-year Computer Science student passionate about building intelligent systems and solving real-world problems with **Python** and **AI**.  
💡 I love working on projects that combine **machine learning**, **deep learning**, and **data-driven decision making**, and I’m currently exploring how to integrate **LLMs** and **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** into practical applications.

---

### 🔭 What I’m Currently Working On
- 🧠 **Prescription Analyzer** – A pipeline combining **OCR**, **FAISS**, and **Mistral LLM** to extract and summarize medicine details from digital as well as handwritten prescriptions.
- 🔍 **RAG Pipeline Exploration** – Building retrieval-augmented generation workflows using **open-source LLMs**, **LangChain**, and experimenting with **.NET Core** integration.

---

### 🌱 What I’m Currently Learning
- 🔗 Advanced **LangChain** concepts for building context-aware AI applications  
- ☁️ Deploying ML models and LLM pipelines on the cloud  
- 🖥️ Backend development with **.NET Core**
